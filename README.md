**A Study Plan**

Here's [the example project](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project).
For this project we transformed the code snippets from the previous episode into a single script [analyse_spreadsheet.py](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project/blob/main/analyse_spreadsheet.py)

Let's take a look at [the script](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project/blob/main/analyse_spreadsheet.py).
You don't need to understand the script completely, all you need to know is:
* The functions `mean_temperature` and `get_spreadsheet_columns` from previous episode are in there.
* We added a `main` function that is called when you run the script
(you could run this python script by calling `python analyse_spreadsheet.py` on the command line).
It will prompt the user for a file name, print the columns in the spreadsheet, and print the mean
temperature.

That's all there is to this project! (You can ignore the other files in the repository, we'll get back to them in episode 4)

**The exercise**

1. Fork the [the example project](https://github.com/escience-academy/coderefinery-documentation-example-project) to your own github namespace
2. Add a file called `README.md` (you can use the github web interface or work locally (i.e. `git clone`, edit the file,  `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`))
3. Add some content to your README file. Think about what you want the audience to know about your project!
   It does not matter whether the information is correct, it is more important that you have all the components that make up a good README file.
4. Note that the README file is nicely rendered on the github repository page.
5. Compare your README file with that of others, is all the essential information in there?
NB: The `README.md` file is written in 'Markdown' a very popular lightweight markup language, all you need to know for now is this syntax:

```markdown
# A section title
## A subsection title
Normal text

A list with items
- item1
- item2
```

(Optional): Use [https://hemingwayapp.com/](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to analyse your README file and make your writing bold and clear!
